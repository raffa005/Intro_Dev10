            <p>Operating 50 years strong, Nick's Crab Shack is a relaxed
              and welcoming place to enjoy a variety of crab, shrimp, lobster,
              and any other succulent delicacy of the sea.  Ever since we openned
              back in 1969, our motto has been fresh from the sea, untampered by man.
              We always aim to make sure you are getting the freshest food possible,
              so we make sure to leave each as close to how nature intended it to be.
              Come on in on Thursdays to enjoy our family crab bucket, or Tuesdays for
              out 2 for 1 lobster date special! Here at Nick's Crab Shack, there's
              always a seat for you.
